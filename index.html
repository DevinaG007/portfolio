           <p class="color-left">
             Currently, I work in retail, but my passion has always been traveling. Last year I left for 3 months to travel through Europe 
             and a couple of countries in Africa. While I was traveling, I created a travel blog to help inspire others, and I realized that I loved
             designing my own website.

             As a student for Thinkful, I have the opportunity to work in a field that gives me the flexibility to travel the world,
             while also doing work that I love.
